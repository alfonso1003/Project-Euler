## Project Euler
(from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler)
<br>
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.[2] It includes over 500 problems,[3] with a new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. A forum specific to each question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question.[4] As of December 2014 Project Euler has over 460,000 users from all over the world (who solved at least one problem).[5]

## Statistics
As of 2 March 2015, I have solved 38 problems. Only 9.079% of Project Euler users have solved as many problems as I have.
